LidarView_ is an open-source, multi-platform tool for the analysis and
visualization of Lidar data. With **LidarView**, you can quickly process point
cloud data from one or multiple sensors and turn it into powerful visualizations.
**LidarView** is built on top of ParaView_, the worldâ€™s leading open source
post-processing visualization engine, which gives **LidarView** access to all
the tools available in **ParaView**. These features are described in the
`ParaView Documentation`_.
